# PWA Icons

This folder should contain the following icon sizes for the Progressive Web App:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are used when the app is installed on a device.

For now, please create these icons using the school logo or a placeholder image. You can use online tools like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/

Or any image editing software to create these icons in the required sizes.
